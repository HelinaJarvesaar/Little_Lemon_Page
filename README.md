# üçã Little Lemon Restaurant
# Booking Table App & Order for Delivery UX/UI Project

## Overview:

- This project was created as part of the Meta Front-End Developer course on Coursera.
- The goal was to design and prototype a **mobile-friendly "Reserve a Table" feature** for a fictional cozy Italian restaurant named **Little Lemon**, set in Florence, Italy.
- The project includes the **entire UX/UI process**, from defining the problem to delivering an interactive, high-fidelity Figma prototype.

- Responsive restaurant app with table reservation form is built with React. 
- It includes form validation, accessibility features (like semantic HTML and ARIA attributes), and is tested using Jest and React Testing Library.

## Objectives

- Improve customer experience by enabling online table reservations.
- Design a mobile-first, intuitive flow with clear visual hierarchy.
- Reflect the warm, authentic brand of a small Italian restaurant.
- Include food ordering functionality with confirmation flow.

## Technologies Used:

- React.js, HTML, CSS
- Figma
- VS Code
- Git, GitHub

## Future improvements:

- Create Order Online Page
- Create Menu Page
- As Figma project and App project were different tasks, then there is a need to make App and Figma work look a same, right now there are some differences.
